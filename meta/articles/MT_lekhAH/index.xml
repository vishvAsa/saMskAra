Theology and AI
Visualization and drift A key feature of most polytheistic religions, typically natural religions, is the importance of a multiplicity of visualizations of deities. This visualization might be solely mental/textual or expressed in different ways in the graphic and plastic arts.
The mode of representation can change dramatically over time in the same religious tradition. For instance, we can infer that the early Indo-Europeans, going back to their Indo-Hittite past, had a fairly elaborate visualization of deities, but it was minimally expressed as physical iconography.</description>

bhakti She said would only marry ranganAtha. In a dream the triple-strider appeared to her father and asked him to send her decked in wedding attire to his shrine. Even as she neared the shrirangaM her father was filled with that inexplicable mixture of joy and sorrow, but she was experiencing unrestrained excitement. As the party reached the temple she jumped out of her palanquin and rushed to the garbhAgR^iha and merged with the 4-handed one in a flash of light.</description>

Humans were not around from the inception in this universe. In fact they are very recent phenomenon given the age of the universe. The shAstra-s (in the broad sense) have been around for just a subset of that period of human existence. At some point the humans &amp;amp; their shAstra-s will become extinct. Thus, if the devatA-s were dependent on the shAstra-s then their existence will be finite &amp;amp; conterminal with the emergence &amp;amp; extinction of species like humans.</description>
