Limbya narrates: When I was a young I was seized by a by a bhoot. It was a huge ghost of the Khais variety that may assume the form of a Meccan demon or a Mohammedan. When I was sleeping one night near my sheep the Khais came and pulled my leg. I was afraid and said f**k you, who is pulling at me. I woke up but could not see anything.</description>
