Swami Shanmuga from Tiruchendur. Why is the Vigraha like this ? There is a history behind it. During the time of Thirumalai Nayakar (1649) who was ruling Madurai, the European powers of Dutch &amp;amp; Portuguese were fighting for a foothold here. Portuguese had a base in Tuticorin, Dutch landed in nearby Tiruchendur &amp;amp; a battle took place between them. After it was won by Dutch, they occupied Tiruchendur temple &amp;amp; made it as their base.</description>
