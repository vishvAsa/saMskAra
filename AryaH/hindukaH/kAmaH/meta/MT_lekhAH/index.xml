The contest between shiva and kAma is much celebrated in Hindu literature. The effects of kAma on shiva have been enshrined in the highest poetry of saMskR^ita by kAlidAsa in poem on the birth of the war-god. But the brahmANDa purANa is unique in providing a version of the tale, where kAma has a second attempt to go at shiva and in this attempt conquers him. It is one of those eternal pieces of decorative prose in Hindu literature.</description>

mukhaM binduM kR^itvA kucha yugam-adhas-tasya tadadho hakArArdhaM dhAyed yo hara-mahiShi te manmatha-kalAM |

Making the bindu to be the face, what is beneath to be the breasts, and what is still underneath one half of the syllable ha, one meditates on your manmatha kalA, oh she queen of hara.
One who does so very easily excites girls; he very soon bewitches the Triple-world with the sun and moon as her breasts.</description>
