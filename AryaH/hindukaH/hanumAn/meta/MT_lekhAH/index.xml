      <description>Source: here.
The chief of the simians The nilamata purANa indicates that the cult of hanumAn emerged relatively early along with that of his master sugrIva. Soon, in the core Tantro-Pauranic effloresence he developed a major cult of his own and that sugrIva cult eventually became extinct. The tantric cult of hanumAn developed as a para-Vaishnava cult and eventually metamorphosed into a pan-Indian cult with considerably complexity. This full-blown complexity was in place by the CE 1500, though hanumAn was a late addition to the Hindu pantheon.</description>

      <description>Indeed the gadA is a rather late iconographic element of hanUmat. It is missing even in the classical tantrika dhyAna-s for the key hanUmat-mantra-s &amp;amp; is not mentioned in the classic mAlA-mantra. It seems to have emerged only in the medieval period in any notable way from a west Indian locus and spread widely but not universally across the subcontinent. The kali~Ngan iconography for e.g. does not show him with one.</description>
