      <description>The order in which the Mahavidyas are given varies somewhat, as do the goddesses included in the group. In contemporary sources, however, the following goddesses in the following order are most common: (1) Kali, (2) Tārā, (3) Tripura-sundari (Sodasi), (4) Bhuvanesvari, (5) Chinnamasta, (6) Bhairavi, (7) Dhumavati, (8) Bagalāmukhī, (9) Matangi, and (10) Kamala. The ten are described in most sources as follows:
Kali is black, which in fact is what her name means.</description>

      <title>02 Typical Literary and Iconographic Contexts</title>

      <description>The Mahavidyas are prominent primarily in tantric literature and in a few late *sakta **purdnas *and *upa **purdnas *(minor, later, or subsidiary *purdnas). *The *tantras *contain little narrative material about the Mahavidyas. They are primarily interested in providing the details of how to worship the Mahavidyas and do not dwell on the meaning of their symbolism or stories that feature them. A typical tantric treatment of a Mahavidya includes, first, her mantra, which is believed to represent her essence; a devotee seeking the goddess&amp;rsquo;s blessing or power must repeat it continually.</description>

      <title>03 The Mahāvidyās as Forms of the Mahādevī</title>

      <description>Both literary and iconographic materials give the general impression that the ten Mahavidyas are different forms of an overarching, transcendent female reality, who is usually referred to simply as the Mahadevi (great goddess). An underlying assumption of many *sakta *texts is that the highest reality is the Great Goddess, and this infinitely great being manifests herself in a wide variety of forms. Indeed, this is perhaps the central feature of Hindu *sdkta *theology in those texts.</description>

      <description>I have come across five versions of the origin of the Mahavidyas as a group. In one of these versions, the Mahavidyas are different forms of the goddess Sati; in a second version they are forms of the goddess Parvati; in a third they arise from the goddess Kali, herself one of the Mahavidyas; in a fourth they are forms of the goddess Durga; and in a fifth they are said to arise from the goddess Sataksi, who is also identified with Sakambhari and Durga.</description>

      <title>05 Interrelationships among the Mahāvidyās</title>

      <description>As a group, the Mahāvidyās present a curious collection of goddesses. If there is an internal coherence to the group that explains how its members are related to each other, it is not readily apparent. Neither in textual sources nor in the contemporary oral tradition have I been able to discover an obvious pattern or logic to the inclusion of these ten goddesses in the same group. There are hints in some texts, and some of my informants have speculated about the question.</description>

      <title>06 Worship of the Mahāvidyās</title>

      <description>The Mahāvidyās are approached in a variety of ritual contexts, and the worship of one Mahavidya may differ from that of others. Some of the Mahāvidyās, for example, have ancient and widespread cults that existed, and still exist, quite apart from the Mahāvidyās as a group. This is the case with Kali, Tara, Tripura-sundari, and Kamala, for example. In general, though, we can think of their worship as taking place primarily in two contexts: in temples, where they are served by priests and where people come to take part in public worship, and in temporary places marked off by individual aspirants, where worship is undertaken in tantric fashion, either right-handed or left-handed.</description>

      <title>07 The Mahāvidyās and Magical Powers</title>

      <description>We have already touched on the association of the Mahavidyas with magical powers, but it is so persistent that we should discuss it in more detail before turning to a treatment of the individual goddesses. Hindu literature is full of stories in which individuals, often demons, undertake ascetic and meditative practices in order to acquire special abilities with which they hope to achieve power, wealth, sex, or some other worldly pleasure or reward.</description>

      <title>08 The Significance of the Term *Mahāvidyā *</title>
      <link>https://vishvAsa.github.io/devaH/AryaH/hindukaH/meta/articles/kinsley/tantric-divine-feminine/1_The_mahAvidyAs_as_a_Group/08_The_Significance_of_the_Term_mahAvidyA/</link>

      <description>A literal translation of the term *mahavidya *is &amp;ldquo;great knowledge,&amp;rdquo; while a somewhat less literal translation might be &amp;ldquo;supreme (or superior or complete) knowledge (or wisdom).&amp;rdquo; There are several possibilities for what the name tells us about the nature and function of the Mahāvidyās. It is not obvious why these ten goddesses should have been so designated, but several explanations are possible.
I have been told by two scholars of Tantrism in Varanasi105 that the term *dasamahavidya *as it applies to the ten goddesses is technical and means the &amp;ldquo;ten great mantras,&amp;rdquo; *vidya *generally being used in this technical sense in tantric contexts.</description>

      <title>09 Concluding Observations</title>

      <description>The ten Mahāvidyās form a distinctive group of deities. Although it includes some well-known goddesses, such as Kali and Laksmi, most of them are little known apart from this group, and several of the goddesses are strikingly unusual (Chinnamasta, Dhumavatl, and Bagalamukhi in particular). The group does not particularly manifest characteristics and functions that typify *sakta *Hinduism, yet they are often said to represent the Mahadevi in her diverse forms. Several texts and secondary sources imply that they sum up, or circumscribe in some fashion, the main features of the Mahadevl.</description>
