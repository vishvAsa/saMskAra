      <description>An underlying theological assumption in texts celebrating the Mahādevī is that the ultimate reality in the universe is a powerful, creative, active, transcendent female being. The Lalitā-sahasranāma gives many names of the Mahādevī, and several of her epithets express this assumption. She is called, for example, the root of the world (Jagatīkandā, name 325), she who transcends the universe (Viśvādhikā, 334), she who has no equal (Nirupamā, 389), supreme ruler (Parameśvarī, 396), she who pervades all (Vyāpinī, 400), she who is immeasurable (Aprameyā, 413), she who creates innumerable universes (Anekakoṭibrahmāṇḍajananī, 620), she whose womb contains the universe (Viśvagarbhā, 637), she who is the support of all (Sarvādhārā, 659), she who is omnipresent (Sarvagā, 702), she who is the ruler of all worlds (Sarvalokeśī, 758), and she who supports the universe (Viśvadhāriṇī, 759).</description>

      <description>The central role the Devī plays in mythology is that of creator and queen of the cosmos. When she is portrayed in her own form (svabhāva), she is usually described as a beautiful young woman in regal attire surrounded by thousands of attendants and seated on a throne in the highest heaven.10 As cosmic queen she oversees or performs directly the three primary cosmic functions of creation, preservation, and destruction. The world is said to be destroyed when she blinks her eyes and to be recreated when she opens her eyes.</description>

      <title>03 AUSPICIOUS AND TERRIBLE FORMS</title>

      <description>Another important feature of Mahādevī mythology and theology is the insistence that she assumes both benign and terrible forms. Most texts extolling the Devī are preoccupied with her benign and auspicious forms, but many texts affirm that she has several manifestations that are dreadful, dangerous, or bloodthirsty.17 In the Devī-bhāgavata-purāṇa (7.33.21–56), in a passage reminiscent of the scene in the Bhāgavad-gītā when Arjuna asks to see Kṛṣṇa’s cosmic form, the gods ask the Devī for a glimpse of her universal form.</description>
