      <description>Sarasvatī as the embodiment of the Sarasvatī River is significant in both a historical and a theological sense. The religion of the Vedic Āryans was primarily a portable religion. It centered around a fire cult that did not require permanent temples or places of worship. The domestic hearth itself was a center of worship. By and large Vedic religion was appropriate for a nomadic people or for a people who only recently had ceased to be nomadic.</description>

      <description>Saravatī’s connection with a river steadily decreases in later Hinduism. Although she continues to be associated with a river in some late sources,6 her characteristics and appearance increasingly bear little or no relation to a goddess who embodies the sacrality of a river.
As early as the Brāhmaṇas Sarasvatī is consistently identified with Vāgdevī, the goddess of speech. It is not at all clear what intrinsic connection between Sarasvatī and Vāgdevī led to this association.</description>
