On the rise of the mātṛkā-s and the goddess Cāmuṇḍā
Ancient roots The roots of the mātṛkā-s in the śruti and the Kaumāra tradition
The standard list of 7/8 goddesses known as the mātṛkā-s is a hallmark feature of the classical religion: Brāhmī, Māheśvarī, Kaumārī, Vaiṣṇavī, Vārāhī, Indrāṇī, Cāmuṇḍā, sometimes with the central Caṇḍikā (Mahālakṣmī), to make a list of 8. Most of them are the female counterparts of the prominent gods of the classical pantheon.</description>

      <description>Source: here.
The mantra of the goddess trailokyavijayA is provided by the yuddha-jayArNava tantraM. A somewhat corrupt version of this tantra is incorporated into the agni purANa. Stand-alone manuscripts of the YJA also exist, though they have not been edited or published. In addition to the version of the agni-purANa I had access to a hand-written transcript on paper. The Dutch explorers have recovered a corrupt version of the same in their collection of Hindu mantras known as stuti-s and stava-s from Indonesia (now only surviving in Bali).</description>

      <title>The AmnAya-krama for the dual worship of shArikA and tripurA</title>

R and I finally got to moving ahead with the initial part of laying out the formulae related to the dual worship of shArikA and tripurA that was prevalent with the Himalayan tantrics. The shArikA-tripurA krama of aghora-shiva is related in terms of the formulae to dakShiNa-mUrti virachita uddhAra-kosha, a famous work on mantra shAstra that contains most of these formulae. The aghora-shiva here is the south-face of rudra or dakShiNa-mUrti.</description>

Long ago the great old vaiShNava wandered in the hallowed oDDiyAna pITha, when he reached an old desolate prAsada towards the evening hour. There he seated himself and concentrated ThaM bIja. Then the divine boar-faced mistress of the 5th lunar digit graced him. She of most beautiful waist appeared there with curly locks and bearing two shining tusks on her snout. Her awesome hips were draped by a most excellent blue and golden vesture and she held the still-bloody pestle with which she had smashed the skull of visha~Nga.</description>

We bow to the great goddess of the trotalottaraM and pay worship to the great throng of yakShiNI-s that emerge from her. The yakShiNI-s are of diverse forms, all very wonderful and amazing. They bear many diverse facets of knowledge — he who can acquire them all becomes sarva-vyApin. But the knowledge is not easily acquired from the yakShiNI. There are so many ways in which they slip away after it has been shown to you by her.</description>

The great tradition of paschimAmnAya goddess, our hallowed mother kubjikA, had a number of streams that are now largely forgotten. One of the older streams before its standardization in the tradition of the kubjikAmata and ShaTsAhasra streams was the worship of kubjikA conjoined with the five headed shiva (distinct from the other representations where she is conjoined with shiva as navAtman (also alluded to in the saundaryalahari; while mainly devoted to kulasundarI, 34, 39 and 41 refer to kubjikA) or has paramashiva above her) .</description>

When in gavalkuNDa, R1 and A saved us from the pangs of hunger. R1, A and our clan had similar histories with peregrinations through the length of jambudvIpa over time in the practice and quest of the mantra-shAstra. R1’s clan had moved back recently to the Southern realms after 2.5 centuries in the land of the malla rAjas. R1 who treated us as son also opened our eyes to some remarkable matters- she us acquainted with her father, who was one the last holders of the vidyA’s of the ShaTsAhasra tradition (since R1 was cashing her brahminical check).</description>

The most glorious urvashI is invoked by her mahAmantra:
oM hrIM eM | abhi na iLA yUthasya mAtA sman nadIbhir urvashI vA gR^iNAtu | oM hrIM eM | urvashI vA bR^ihad-divA gR^iNAnA .abhyUrNvAnA prabhR^ithasyAyoH | huM svAhA
The mantras of urvashI and tillotamA are unparalled in the bliss they give. The highest joys of svarga may be glimpsed by the invocation of the glorious apsaras of great power. The might of the pa~nchachoDA of the apsaras protects him from his bhrAtR^ivyas.</description>

Since I was asked of the famed bhinna yoni vidyA, which powers the mahA mAtR^ikA nyAsa I have written it down. Of course its prakaTa as pratya~NgirA needs the inter-twining with the atharvamukha, of which the bhinna yoni is itself a prakaTa rUpa. Its manifestation as parameshvarI is can be seen in the stand alone bhinna yoni vidyA, though a practioner of the bhrigu-A~Ngirasa shruti notes the deep concordance with the atharvamukha constantly.</description>

The bhUta tantras recommend the worship of apasaras and provide the outlines for these rites. However, their proper deployment remains unknown except to one who has mastered the true rahasyas. The mantras of the practioners of the chInAchAra are nowhere in the league of these rahasya mantras. 8 principal apsaras may be invoked with apasara maNDala though tillotamA may be offered a special sacrifice for the highest purpose. The apasaras who are invoked are:</description>

Intro The core pantheon of the pA~ncharAtra texts is the chaturvyuha or the serial emanations of nArAyaNa. The primary manifestation of nArAyaNa is vAsudeva, from whom emerge saMkarShaNa and pradyumna. From pradyumna emerges aniruddha. This pantheon appears to be a unique feature of the yadu tribes that subsequently seems to have spawned the classical pA~ncharAtra. However, the early texts suggest that there was another parallel system that appears to have largely passed out of subsequent vaiShNavism.</description>

The harsh cawing of the solitary crow at night announces her presence. Of large size with dishevelled hair she roams. The severed heads of viShNu and rudra are seen beside her. The mystic bIja graaaM is reverberating all around her. There are the senAs of the lulApamukhas around her commanded by the dreaded kAlavAhanavadana. Beside her sits her fair daughter rakta-jyeShThA or upa-dhUmrA. Her pArshadhas are yelling hideous statements like without shivA, shiva is but a shava.</description>

The bhArgava sage mArkaNdeya narrated the 3 tales of the fierce goddess and the battles they fought.
The first tale was that of mahAkAli. On account of her mAya, the great god viShNu lay in slumber when the plane was submerged in the waters at the end of the kalpa. There arose from the wax in his ears two terrible daityas, madhu and kaiTabha. They rapidly advanced to slay brahmA when mahAkAli in order to awaken viShNu arose from his forehead and departed.</description>

      <description>Source: TW
The incantations of the 9 kAtyAyanI-s are preserved in a Mongol variant of the bhUtadAmara text. With a minimal patina, these seem to have been absorbed from a shaiva text. The Skt text mentions 8 kAtyAyanI-s, but the text gives 9: &amp;ldquo;aShTau bhUta-rAj~nI-kAtyAyanI-vidyAH paThita-mAtreNa sidhyanti ||&amp;rdquo;
The sumbhakAtyAyanI is probably a bauddha insert into the original set of the remaining 8. The rite is prescribed thus: The sAdhaka goes to a cemetery and repeats one of the kAtyAyanI mantra 1008 times for three days.</description>

      <description>The etymology of the goddess chAmuNDA has mystified old &amp;amp;modern scholars alike. The great mantravAdin bhAskararAya correctly realized that it might stem from some local (non-Aryan) tongue.
Within the Sanskrit tradition the paurANika-s have attempted to give it various functional explanations within the context of the battles fought by the goddess. While the most prevalent one is in mahAsaravatI cycle relating to the killing of chaNDa and muNDa -&amp;gt; chAmuNDA there are alternative versions.</description>

(Continuing from hayagrIva bhairava note.)
Finally, in the eastern locus, such a form is hinted in the kAlikA-purANa which assumes a vaiShNava hayagrIva center in kAmAkhya before the shAkta dominance. The worship of this hayagrIva is still recommended in the kAlikA &amp;amp; suggests a worship of hayagrIva conjoint with the bhairava, vAsudeva, viShNu and varAha.
Was kAmaakhya in the remote past likely a shrine to the vaiShNavI ekAnaMshA? The kalikapurANa hints at the widespread worship as per pañcarātra before the curse to ugratArA.</description>

A rendering of the manifestation of supreme shakti navAtmikA of the pashchimAMnAya. The Agama explains the emergence of the navAtmikA form thus in the teaching of umA to shiva:
शशाङ्कार्ध-कला ज्ञेया
अम्बिका मध्यचन्द्रिका । एका एव पराशक्तिस्
त्रिधा सा च प्रजायते ॥
The goddess ambikA manifest in the midst of the half-moon triplicated herself (technically the central triangle of the yantra). This triad of goddess are the shakti-s vAmA, jyeShThA and raudrI, corresponding to the first 3 deities of the vAmadeva-brahma-mantra</description>

In the 1000s, the chera mantravAdin IshAnashiva composed a mantra manual wherein he described tvaritA as being the form assumed by umA when she accompanied rudra to give arjuna the pAshupata missile.
tvaritA was present in the ancestral kaula tradition and has a place in most of the successor kulAmnAya-s. In the pashchimAmnAya she is an emanation of kubjikA in the middle of a maNDala known as the khecharI chakra with the eponymous yoginI-s.</description>

Almost 20 years ago on a defunct internet forum I&amp;rsquo;d written about the H cognate of Brigid. I agree with you that bhR^ihatI per se is not a theonym specific to the uShas-es. It is also applied to a distinct goddess sarasvatI. However, the cognate of Brigid does exist in our midst as the great goddess, mother bR^ihaddivA also known as the celestial urvashI &amp;ndash; we make an oblation to her in the patnIsaMyAja of the new/full-moons.</description>

The tirumantiram represents a syncretic tradition combining the siddhAnta &amp;amp; the traipura systems. The drAviDa-stotra to vArAhI you cited from it is indeed clear on this matter. It inheres specifically from the kameshvarI lineage of the traipura system that was particularly strong in the drAviDa country as presented in the lalitopAkhyAna. In that vArAhI &amp;amp; her 1000 pArShadI-s are incorporated independently of the other mAtR^i-s as daNDanAthA or the commander of the armies of kAmeshvarI.</description>
