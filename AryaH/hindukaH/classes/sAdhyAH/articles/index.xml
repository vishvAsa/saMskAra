      <description>General A Gaṇadevatā. These Devatās often used to play an important role in Purāṇic movements and incidents. The Sādhyas were born from the seed virāṭ puruṣa. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 1, Verse 35). But according to viṣṇu purāṇa (Part 1, Chapter 35) the Sādhyas were the grand-children of dakṣa-prajāpati. Of the sixty daughters of the prajāpati by his wife Asiknī, ten were married by Dharmadeva; The viśvadevas were the sons of Dharmadeva by his wife viśvā and the Sādhyas were his sons by sādhyā.</description>
