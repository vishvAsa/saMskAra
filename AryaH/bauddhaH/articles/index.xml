The 13th Century CE, depiction of Fudo Myoo, also known as Acala, is a remarkable artifact from Japanese Buddhism&amp;hellip; This piece reflects the profound spiritual and artistic traditions of Japan.
Acala (&amp;ldquo;The Immovable&amp;rdquo;), also known as Acalanātha (&amp;ldquo;Immovable Lord&amp;rdquo;), a wrathful deity and dharmapala (protector of Dharma) prominent in Vajrayana Buddhism and East Asian Buddhism.
Canonical position Originally a minor deity described as messenger or acolyte of buddha Vairocana, Acala later rose to prominence as an object of veneration in his own right as a remover of obstacles and destroyer of evil, eventually becoming seen as wrathful manifestation of either Vairocana, buddha Akṣobhya or bodhisattva Mañjuśrī.</description>
