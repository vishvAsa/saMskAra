      <description>As an aside I was looking up the Tibetan book of dead, ~1300s; 1 encounter numerous avi-/thero-cephalic iconographies of H goddesses absorbed by the vajrayAna from shaiva tradition. There we have:
the wolf-headed bluish-green vAyudevI brown ibex-headed agnAyI sow-headed vArAhI the brownish crow-headed chAmunNDI darkgreen elephant-headed bhUjanA snake-headed blue-green varuNAnI Some of iconographies are not TMK seen in a surviving H text but could have once been there.</description>

In the kAlikA purANa, shivadUtI is interestingly described as being emanated from the heart of the goddess kaushikI due to a meditation of viShNu (hari):
कौशिक्या हृदयाद् देवी निःसृता ध्यायतो हरेः ।
शिवदूतीति सा ख्याता या च देव-शतैर् वृता ॥
She is said to be surrounded by a 100 gods. Elsewhere, she is described as pherushatair vR^itA: does this imply the gods took the form of jackals, or is it merely a scribal slip?</description>
