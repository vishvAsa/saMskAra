Dispersal Israel arrival YHWH did not belong to the traditional pantheons of deities in the region of Syria and Canaan, His name is not found in the ancient texts of Ebla, Mari or Ugarit. YHWH was likely originally an autonomous multi functional deity in the southern region who covered the most important areas of life. Later, YHWH seemed to take on the attributes of the Levantine kingly weather god, which was His main profile during the early Judahite monarchy.</description>
